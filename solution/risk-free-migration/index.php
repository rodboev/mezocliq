    <p>Surgeons can transplant a heart or even a face, and architects can move buildings across oceans. So why is it one never hears of a successful technology migration?</p>
    <p>We think the devil is in the details. Little details matter. They matter a lot. As in any migration, there are many of them in technology. All too often, these are left to a &ldquo;system integrator&rdquo;&mdash;who makes them up case by case.</p>
    <p>We have spent years studying these details at Mezocliq. We have mapped the details in logical sequence and automated their execution&mdash;especially in the riskiest phases of data migration.</p>
    <p>For starters, our approach is thoroughly modular&mdash;we offer you very fine control over the scope and pace of migration. You can migrate just &ldquo;reference&rdquo; data. Or migrate selected processes&mdash;Employee Recruiting or Derivatives Trading. And you can do these for your entire company or for a single legal entity at a time.</p>
    <p>Next, just as a surgeon first creates a &ldquo;backup&rdquo; organ, we build a fresh environment into which your data is migrated. This way, your existing systems continue to function as long as you wish. You cut over when you choose&mdash;in a week or a year.</p>
    <p>Finally, our system performs all validations upfront&mdash;it won&rsquo;t load flawed data. Our validations are all-encompassing&mdash;from checking convoluted relationships to cross-referencing across inter-dependent processes. Gaps are flagged clearly&mdash;so users can correct issues before they pollute your new body.</p>
