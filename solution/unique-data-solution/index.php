    <p>Every organization struggles to centralize its technology. Each business unit, country and function wants its own applications for its specialized processes. They generally prevail.</p>
    <p>What follows is an explosion of systems, each with distinct&mdash;and often incompatible&mdash;data models. But over time these systems have to communicate with each other.</p>
    <p>So starts a proliferation of data hubs and warehouses, along with armies of consultants. But all the glue and effort fails to put the enterprise back together again.</p>
    <p>In contrast, Mezocliq offers an end-to-end data solution that permanently unifies all your data in a single repository. No exceptions.</p>
    <p>How can we succeed, when so many others have tried? We didn&rsquo;t approach this as a purely technical problem&mdash;we saw it as a problem in business semantics and linguistics.</p>
    <p>We studied dozens of industries, hundreds of processes and millions of variables. From these we abstracted a generic data model that can handle all enterprise data and processes.</p>
    <p>We paid special attention to data governance.   We wrote applications for onboarding data. We automated procedures for maintaining data integrity permanently&mdash;in the face of a continuously changing application landscape.</p>
    <p>And we leveraged newer non-relational database technology, which scales better than relational databases when handling the load and complexity of modern data.</p>
    <p>Our data solution facilitates rapid-fire analytics. Queries are done at search-engine speed, and datasets for complex analytics are assembled in minutes. Our centralized data environment provides data access in any form you choose&mdash;files, APIs or streaming. And, we added a friendly extraction tool for non-technical uses, so data is finally available to everyone, not just a select few.</p>
    <p>When it comes to data management in a big-data world, we know of no parallel to our IP.</p>
